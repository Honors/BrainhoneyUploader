# Brainhoney Uploader
This app is meant to allow iPad users to upload assignments to Brainhoney. It
achieves this by two primary innovations:

1. A file is imported through "Open with ..." buttons of other apps and cached
   for later uploading.
2. A web browser is used to render the Brainhoney website and observe assignment
   browsing. Once the user settles on an assignment, their choice, too, is cached.
