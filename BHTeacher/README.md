# Teacher Edition
The Teacher Edition of the Brainhoney Uploader is very similar to the
student edition.

## Interface
The interface is largely the same as the student edition, with a different
icon color.

An "Isolate Attachments" button allows for attachment links to be parsed
out and rendered in a usable way for iPad users.

## Implementation
Uploading teacher assets is very easy in Brainhoney. The upload and submit
processes are separated out, simplifying our job.

## Todo
- Render status bar based on activity.
